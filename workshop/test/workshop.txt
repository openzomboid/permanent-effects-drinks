description=[h1]How to Use[/h1]
description=[olist]
description=    [*] You can spawn drinks as admin. Use /additem Permanent.Code to add drink to inventory.
description=    [*] Or configure recipes on sandbox settings and allow players to craft drinks.
description=[/olist]
description=
description=[h2]How to create new recipes?[/h2]
description=After the first launch of the game with the Moonshine Elixirs mod, a moonshine-recipes.json (or moonshine-recipes-b42.json) file will be created in the ~/Zomboid/Lua folder. It contains all available recipes in json format. You can change any values in them and add new recipes. The file must contain two blocks: Vanilla for vanilla drink recipes that are already in the game and Exclusive for drink recipes from the Moonshine Elixirs mod.
description=
description=[h1]Configuration[/h1]
description=In the sandbox settings there is a "Permanent Effects Drinks" tab where you can change the following settings:
description=[list]
description=    [*][b]Keep Experience[/b] - If enabled, the experience gained will be carried over to the next level when using drinks. Due to the nature of the game, there is a dependence on the state of the character. For example, with a greatly reduced weight or frailty of a character, the accumulated experience may be reduced by 30% or even not saved at all. For the best effect of the drink, the player must take care of the good condition of the character. [b]Anticheat Type15 must be disabled on the server.[/b]
description=    [*][b]Slender Doe sets weight[/b] - Sets the value of the weight that the player receives when drinking the Slender Doe drink.
description=    [*][b]Allow to build moonshine still[/b] - Allow or disallow players to build Moonshine Still workbench.
description=    [*][b]Allow to brew Vanilla alcohol[/b] - Allow or disallow players to brew Vanilla alcohol such as Bourbon, Wine and Beer on the Moonshine Still workbench.
description=    [*][b]Allow to brew Exclusive alcohol[/b] - Allow or disallow players to brew Exclusive alcohol such as Slender Doe, Nicotine Overdose etc. on the Moonshine Still workbench.
description=    [*][b]Allow to spawn Moonshine Recipe Book in Zombies loot[/b]
description=    [*][b]Chance for spawn Moonshine Recipe Book in all Zombies loot[/b] - Value from 0 to 200 that configures the chance for found Moonshine Recipe Book in zombies. It is recommended to use values lower than 0.001. After saving small value such as 0.001 will be displayed as 1.0e-4. Don't panic, this is normal for this game.
